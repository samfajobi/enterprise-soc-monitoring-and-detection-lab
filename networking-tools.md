## 1. Overview

Computer networks are built using multiple devices and technologies, each with a **specific responsibility**. Understanding these tools is critical for:

* Network troubleshooting
* Cloud architecture
* Security monitoring (SOC)
* Incident response

This documentation focuses on **what each tool does**, **where it operates (OSI layers)**, and **its security relevance**.

## 2. Modem (Modulator–Demodulator)

### What It Is

A modem connects a private network to an **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** by translating ISP signals into digital data.

### Key Functions

* Converts ISP signals (fiber, cable, DSL) into Ethernet data
* Assigns a public IP address (from ISP)
* Acts as the gateway to the internet

### OSI Layer

* Layer 1 (Physical)
* Layer 2 (Data Link)

### Security Relevance

* Limited visibility and control
* Often managed by ISP
* Rarely provides detailed logs

## 3. Router

### What It Is

A router connects **multiple networks** and directs traffic between them.

### Key Functions
