### What a Modem Is

Modem = MOdulator + DEModulator

A modem’s job is to translate signals between:

   * Your Internet Service Provider (ISP)

   * Your local network

Your ISP sends internet data using signals that your home devices cannot understand directly (fiber light signals, cable signals, DSL signals).
The modem converts those signals into digital data your router and devices can use.
