# 🔐 Wazuh SIEM and Firewall Log Monitoring (SOC Home Lab)

## 📌 Overview

This project showcases a **Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab** built with **Wazuh SIEM** and integrated with a **network firewall OPNsense** to monitor, detect, and analyze security events across both **endpoint and network layers**.

The lab centralizes security logs from endpoints, authentication services, and firewall devices, enabling effective **security monitoring, alert triage, and incident investigation**. Firewall logs are forwarded to Wazuh using syslog, allowing visibility into suspicious activities such as **unauthorized access attempts, port scanning, brute-force attacks, and network policy violations**.

Designed to mirror real-world enterprise SOC environments, this project demonstrates practical hands-on experience with **SIEM operations, firewall log analysis, event correlation, and defense-in-depth security monitoring**.

## 🧾 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a production-style SOC lab environment using open-source tools.  
I deployed **Wazuh SIEM** on Ubuntu and installed agents on multiple operating systems to collect logs, detect threats, and simulate attacks using MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

This lab helps me practice:
- Endpoint detection & response
- Log analysis
- Incident detection & triage
- Linux auditd event monitoring
- Brute-force detection
- Threat hunting
- Windows & Linux security monitoring
