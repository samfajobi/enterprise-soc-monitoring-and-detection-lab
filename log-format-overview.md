# Overview of Log File Formats

Logs record events that happen on a system, application, or network. In cybersecurity, logs provide key details about activities across an organization, such as who signed into an application at a specific point in time, what actions were performed, and where those actions originated from.

As a security analyst, **log analysis** is the process of examining logs to identify events of interest, suspicious behavior, or malicious activity. Understanding how different log formats are structured is critical for uncovering key details during investigations and for effective SIEM analysis.

This document covers the following common log formats:
* JSON
* Syslog
* XML
* CSV
* CEF
